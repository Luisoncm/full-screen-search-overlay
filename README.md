# WordPress Full Screen Search Overlay Plugin

This plugin allows you to create a full screen search overlay in WordPress.

There are no settings for this plugin. Simply activate it, and it works.

Once the plugin is activated, you can click on an existing search field or search button, and it will display the full screen search overlay.

Basically this plugin displays a full screen search overlay for your default WordPress search forms.
